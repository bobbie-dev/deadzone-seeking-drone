# ðŸ“¡ Cellular Signal Quality Logger & Visualizer

This project logs cellular module signal quality data while in motion (e.g., on a drone) and visualizes it on a map using Python. It is useful for testing coverage, handoff behavior, and connectivity in mobile scenarios.

---

## ðŸ§° Features

- Logs signal quality (RSSI, RSRP, RSRQ, SINR) from cellular modules (e.g., SIM7600, SIM8200)
- Logs GPS data (lat, lon, alt, timestamp)
- Saves data to CSV or NetCDF format
- Visualizes signal strength across geospatial locations using `matplotlib` and `Basemap`
